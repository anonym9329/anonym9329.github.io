        <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>
            <h5>This paper presents an automatic harmonization method that generates a
            musically-meaningful chord sequence for a given melody (sequence of musical
            notes). A standard way is to use hidden Markov models (HMMs) that represent
            chord transitions on a regular time grid (e.g., bar or beat grid). This
            approach, however, cannot handle the rhythms, harmonic functions (e.g., tonic,
            dominant, and subdominant), and hierarchical repetitive structures of chords,
            which are all important for melody harmonization. To overcome this limitation,
            we formulate a hierarchical generative model of melodies that consists of (1) a
            probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) for a chord sequence with functions,
            (2) a metrical Markov model describing chord rhythms, and (3) a Markov model
            that generates a melody from a chord sequence. To estimate a chord sequence
            with a variable length and rhythm for a given melody, we iteratively refine the
            latent tree structure and the labels and durations of chords by using a
            Metropolis-Hastings sampler with split-merge operations. Experimental results
            showed that the proposed method outperformed the HMM-based harmonizer in terms
            of predictive ability and musical appropriateness.<h5>

        <h3>Experimental Results</h3>

         <h5>The figure above shows how the proposed MH sampling method with split-merge operations worked for automatic harmonization. The number of kinds of non-terminal symbols, K, was set to 12. A musical score at the top of the figure shows an initial sample in which the chord labels were optimized by using the Viterbi algorithm, but the chord onsets were located at the bar lines at the beginning of sampling. The second score shows a sample proposed by moving the onset positions of 5th and 6th chords (G major and C major). The third score shows a sample proposed by merging the 7th and 8th chords (F major and C major) into one chord (C major). The bottom score shows the best sample that maximizes the likelihood for the given melody. In each of the processes, the likelihood increased after refining variables. The result indicates that proposed method can successfully generate a musically-meaningful variable-length sequence of chords by considering the latent tree structure behind the chord sequence.</h5>
